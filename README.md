## Notes

Around challenge three, I spent a lot of time trying to diagnose an issue with my for-loop, which turned out to be just a poor placement of brackets. 

Customizing the color scheme while maintaining good contrast took a bit of time. If I were to continue with this project, I would want to figure out how to make the local navigation bar stick to the top of the screen as the user scrolls.
